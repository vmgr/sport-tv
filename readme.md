-   npm (included with Node.js)

### Installation

1.  **Clone:**

    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**

### Configuration (config.js)

Open config.js and adjust these variables. You can use environment variables for production.

-   ADDON_PORT: Port where the addon will run (default: 7000).

-   IMAGE_GENERATOR_BASE_URL: URL of your image generation server. Required for dynamic posters. Deploy from:
    [![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/git/external?repository-url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FWebStaticCS%2FImage-Generator.git&project-name=image-generator&repo-name=Image-Generator)

    Use your Vercel deployment URL (e.g., https://your-generator.vercel.app/api/generate-image).

-   TIMEZONE_OFFSET_HOURS: UTC offset for displaying event times (default: -5).
-   Note: You can add more event images to poster_data.js if needed

### Running the Addon

1.  **Start:**

    ```
    node app.js
    ```

2.  The console will show the installation URL (e.g., http://127.0.0.1:7000/manifest.json). Paste it into Stremio > Addons > Install Addon.

### Important Notes

-   Streams: Playback issues are usually due to CORS.

-   Cache: If changes don't appear, clear the addon cache in Stremio or reinstall the addon.

-   Environment Variables: For production deployment (e.g., Vercel), use environment variables for configurations.
